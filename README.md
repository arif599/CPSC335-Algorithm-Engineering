# CPSC 335 Algorithm Engineering
Instructor: Yu Pan (yupan3@fullerton.edu)

## Course Description:
Algorithm design using classical patterns: exhaustive search, divide and conquer, randomization, hashing, reduction, 
dynamic programming, and the greedy method. Asymptotic and experimental efficiency analysis. NP-completeness and decidability. 
Implementing algorithms to solve practical problems.

## Course Learning Objectives:
1. Analyze the efficiency of algorithms. We will define efficiency with mathematical precision, and learn experimental and mathematical methods for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. 
2. Use asymptotic analysis to make design decisions about tradeoffs between runtime, space consumption, and programming effort. 
3. Apply common algorithmic problem-solving strategies. We will cover seven classical patterns for designing algorithms, and noteworthy algorithms based upon those strategies. You will practice designing new algorithms using each strategy. 
4. Implement algorithms and observe how our model of efficiency relates to real-world performance. 
5. Reduce new problems to classical problems with known solutions. 6. Understand important complexity classes of problems: P, NP, NP-complete, and undecidable.
